          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>In general, you can visit our Website without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

        <p>If you choose to use any referral service we provide to "tell-a-friend" about our products (including products offered by our partners) or our Website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will then send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the Website or check out the product offering. We will store your friend’s name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message. We do not keep or use this information for any other purpose. You will be deemed to have obtained the consent of your friend for such use and storage of your friend’s name and email. Whatever the purpose may be, we will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.</p>

SPI means Personal Information such as your password; physical, physiological and mental health condition; medical records and history; biometric information; sexual orientation; and financial information (such as bank account details or credit card numbers). SPI collected by the Team shall not be disclosed without your express consent, save as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy or the Website’s terms and conditions or as provided in an agreement between the Team and you or as required by law. It is clarified that this condition shall not apply to publicly available information, including SPI, in relation to you on the Website.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that in the course of providing the services, the Team may receive SPI from content posted on the Website, and hereby consent and agree to allow the Team to store and display the SPI collected in this manner on the Website and disclose it in the same manner as the content available on the Website.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Deletion of your Personal Information</em>
          </strong>
        </h4>

        <p>Some of our web pages may also utilise "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about your activity on our Website.

Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you may need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of our Website.</p>
        <p>Tracking technologies may automatically record information such as Internet domain and host names; other information about your geographic location; IP addresses; browser software and operating system types; CPU type; your manner of connecting to the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband access); click paths; and dates and times that our Website is accessed. Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our Website and your web experience. We may also analyse information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics. Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control. </p>

Any use of this Website or any of its features by a child under the age of 18 must be with parental supervision. We do not knowingly contact children under the age of 18 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent’s permission. We do not knowingly ask a child under age of 18 for more Personal Information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity on our Website.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Uses of Personal Information</em>
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>We may use Personal Information and other information received and collected from you to provide the services you may have requested, including creation of a publicly accessible profile on our fan club, services that display customised content to you and to contact you upon your request and when otherwise necessary. We may also use Personal Information for auditing, research and analysis, and to operate and improve our services. In some circumstances, we may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your Personal Information or for using it for the above-mentioned purposes, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may also share Personal Information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services.</p>
        <p>Where we propose to use your Personal Information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.</p>
        <h4>
          <strong>
            <em>Confidentiality and Security</em>
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>We will keep confidential and protect your Personal Information except where disclosure is required or permitted by law.</p>
        <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and, once we receive it, for storage and disposal. When you enter sensitive information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). All information we gather is securely stored within databases controlled by us. The databases are stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
        <p>We limit access to Personal Information to employees, agents, consultants and advisors who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</p>
        <p>Third parties provide certain services available on our Website and on our behalf. We may provide information, including Personal Information, to third-party service providers to help us deliver our products, information, and services efficiently and effectively. Service providers are also an important means by which we maintain our Website and mailing lists. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on our behalf through confidentiality agreements and otherwise. We do not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on our behalf unless such transfer is legally required. Similarly, it is against our policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.</p>
        <p>If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Personal Information from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Your Personal information may be collected and stored on servers located in any part of the world in accordance with our data management policy and practices and our service provider engagements.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Third Party Websites</em>
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <p>If you click on a link to a third party site or otherwise leave the Website you will go to a website that is outside our control. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your Personal Information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as we do. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services. If you visit a third party website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that website’s privacy policy before providing any Personal Information.</p>

          <strong>
            <em>Change of Control</em>
          </strong>
        </h4>

        <h4>
          <strong>
            <em>Accuracy</em>
          </strong>
        </h4>
