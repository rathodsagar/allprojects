											<p>Seeking the right combination of insights, intellectual rigor, and convenience, <b>Hala Matar Choufany</b> was delighted to discover the Senior Executive Leadership Program — Middle East</a> (SELPME), which had everything she was looking for in a program. Shortly after arriving on campus, she sat down to discuss what brought her to Harvard Business School (HBS) and what she’s gained so far.</p>

										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What were you looking for when you discovered SELPME?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>I was specifically looking for an educational opportunity that was tailored to executives. I've completed my MBA, studied at three different schools, and participated in other academic programs that support my work. But I had been searching for an educational opportunity that would support my executive role, and I found exactly what I was looking for in the Senior Executive Leadership Program—Middle East.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>Why did SELPME specifically appeal to you?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>It was a combination of factors—the modules, the professors, the learning experience. But I also liked being able to participate at HBS in Boston as well as in Dubai.<br/>
												The SELPME program was also particularly relevant for me. As someone who runs an organization in the Middle East and Africa, it makes sense to further develop my network where I'm hoping to generate more business. And while I've developed a lot of industry knowledge over the years, I also felt that I needed a refresher and a different perspective.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What have you learned from the program?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>For me, the takeaway has been that leaders need both in-depth and big-picture approaches to run their organizations. It's easy to get stuck in the micro details of your day-to-day responsibilities. This program is a good opportunity to step back and take a look at the big picture.<br/>
												This chance to refocus is a lesson in itself. It's important to take the time to think through how we can refocus our strategy, because that, in turn, will help us to better understand our businesses.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What surprised you most about the program?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>I was pleasantly surprised at the level of engagement and diversity of participants. I work in a male-dominated space and, as such, have attended conferences in which I'm the only woman out of 200 men, but not here. It's nice to engage with other women. Ten of the 60 participants here are women. That's almost 20 percent, which is a great start, especially when you look at the context of coming from the Middle East.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>How have the program's two locations influenced your experience?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>SELPME not only provides the experience of being at HBS in Boston, but also the opportunity to be in Dubai. When I looked at other programs, it never seemed possible to block out six months away from work and family commitments. But this program format lets me be home when I need to be.</li>

									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What sets the SELPME program apart?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>To be successful, a program must offer variety and quality—and Harvard offers both. And it's not just the academics and what you learn in the program—the Harvard network is one that you carry for a lifetime. There are very few schools and organizations that provide this kind of close and lasting culture.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What's it like living with other program participants?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>It's really nice. We came in at 10:30 one night, gathered in the living room, and just talked—not about the program's case studies, but just to get to know each other on a personal level. It was just fantastic!</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>Do you think there's a need for educational opportunities tailored specifically to executives in the Middle East?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>It's very important. The biggest growth that we will see in the next 10–15 years could potentially be in the Middle East. It's definitely encouraging, when I look at who's attending this program, to see that companies in the Middle East understand the importance of bringing their decision-makers to the highest level of international education.</li>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-sm-12">
											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What advice would you give to other program participants when they arrive on the Harvard campus?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info">
												<li>My view is that what you get out of SELPME depends on how much you put into it. Yes, it's great to be at Harvard, but it's up to you to make most of it. If you've taken the time to come out to Boston, make sure your time is well invested and that you leverage the available opportunities.

											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>It's definitely been a positive experience so far. The staff has been very welcoming. Harvard Business School (HBS) is a marvelous experience on its own, and living and working alongside other executives is wonderful. By talking before and after the program each day, the group ensures that you get all the important information. It's an excellent way to learn.

											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>This program has helped me truly understand the fundamentals of what it means to be a senior executive. There's such a wealth of knowledge available to participants, and the program communicates it in a way that's easily accessible, friendly, and very rich.

											<h1 class="heading"><span class="left-arrow"></span>What do you think of the program's format?</h1>
											<ul class="curriculum-info border-bottom">
												<li>It's very practical. Because the program is broken into four modules stretched over five months, I was able to gain the information and learning experience I anticipated without needing to relocate to a new country for half a year. The HBS campus module has long hours—we start 6:30 a.m. and end at 10:00 p.m. —but we don’t really feel it. We enjoyed every minute of it.

												<li>Hearing about others' experiences, especially during group discussions, has enhanced my own program experience. Working on a team with diverse professionals has advanced my way of thinking and, in some cases, made me think differently. And collaborating with others from the same region means that we have the same economic, technological, and business challenges. This enriches our discussions of customers and regulators and enhances our ability to overcome challenges to achieve better results.

												<li>Case study discussions have been very beneficial in helping us think through the process, challenges, and overriding success factors of various real-life scenarios. These discussions have been extremely useful, and I think the valuable lessons we've learned will benefit each of our organizations.

												<li>I understand why some people may feel intimidated by the Harvard name, but I haven't met anyone in the program who feels that way. The school has been very welcoming, and I’ve found the people, process, and program to be very positive. Honestly, it's been the opposite of intimidating—and we all feel proud to be a part of the name.

We're all accustomed to our own ways of doing business, so it’s incredibly rewarding when you learn to think in a different way. This program is a game changer—both in terms of how to do business and how to lead your team.<br/>
												If I were to speak with a prospective participant, I would say enjoy every moment, enjoy every teacher, and fully focus on the program. The cases are amazing—and we had the opportunity to look at them from every angle. In this program, we had 14 professors, each of whom shared their unique expertise, knowledge, and experiences.
