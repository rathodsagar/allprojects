                    <p class="mb-3">We utilise open data to inform public understanding on a range of issues, with the aim of fostering better governance and more transparency and accountability in governance. Founded in late 2011 by Govindraj Ethiraj, a television and print journalist and former Founder Editor-in-Chief of Bloomberg TV India, <b>IndiaSpend</b> is rapidly growing to become an ‘agency of record’ on data and facts on the Indian social and political economy, particularly in areas such as education and healthcare.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We believe data is crucial for public discourse on important policy issues, and our stories strive to foster data-led discussion and analysis at a time when citizens are becoming an active part of the governance process. A related objective is also to make the use of data exciting and a first recourse for young India, rather than opinion, by reaching them through the social media and in innovative formats.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">In March 2014, we also launched <b>FactChecker.in</b>, a dedicated fact-checking initiative that examines statements and assertions by prominent figures in public life for both accuracy and context. In April 2019, we launched <b>HealthCheck.in</b>, a one-of-its-kind resource on public health reporting in India.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We are happy and proud to announce that IndiaSpend has completed 10 years this year.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">We began with the objective of addressing the shortage of data- and evidence-led journalism in India. Back then, the now ubiquitous “data desk” was not even conceived of in most newsrooms. Over a decade, we have shone the light on the essentials that affect our lives: public health, education, gender equity, social justice, climate change and environment, and livelihoods.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><b>IndiaSpend</b> is a non-profit and a project of The Spending & Policy Research Foundation based in Lower Parel in Mumbai, and registered as a Charitable Trust with the Charity Commissioner, Mumbai.</p>
