							A subscriber can withdraw a maximum 60% as lump sum. The remaining 40% of the corpus will have to be annuitized. You may choose to purchase an annuity for an amount greater than 40% of the corpus. (One can also annuitize 100% of the corpus). However, if the Corpus at the time of exit from NPS at the age of 60 years is less than 2 lakhs, Subscriber has the option to withdraw the entire amount in lump sum.
							<br/><br/>
							In case of exit from NPS on attainment of the age 60, subscriber can defer the withdrawal option till 10 years. That means, if at the time of exit from NPS (on attaining the age 60), can let the amount remain in NPS account and he can opt for withdrawal at any point of time before he attains the age 70 years. However, in case of pre – mature exit from NPS (before attaining the age of 60 years), Subscriber does not have option to defer the option.
